#Let's make an awesome Rock-Paper-Scissors game with all those features in Python. Here's the code for you:


import random

def get_user_choice():
    user_choice = input("Choose rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        user_choice = input("Invalid choice. Please choose rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    return user_choice

def get_computer_choice():
    return random.choice(['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'])

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    user_score = 0
    computer_score = 0
    
    while True:
        user_choice = get_user_choice()
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        
        print(f"You chose: {user_choice}")
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
        
        result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        print(result)
        
        if result == "You win!":
            user_score += 1
        elif result == "Computer wins!":
            computer_score += 1
        
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if play_again != 'yes':
            break
    
    print(f"Final Score - You: {user_score} Computer: {computer_score}")

play_game()


#You can run this code in a Python environment, and it will allow you to play Rock-Paper-Scissors with the computer, keeping track of scores and letting you play multiple rounds. 
#Have fun playing, and let me know if you need any more help or modifications!
